# a childhood memory

My world was white with mesmerizing cyan stripes. With my eyes being a nose length away from my father’s shirt, it couldn't be much else. My whole body was vibrating softly and a constant hum filled my ears. My mother held me sandwiched between her and my father, and my sister sat securely in front between my father’s feet.

Our family of four fit well on a tiny moped. Sometime after that, we needed more vehicles.

And what was my world is not even a part of my horizon.
