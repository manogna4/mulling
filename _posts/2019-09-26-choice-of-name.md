We have decided on meraki as the surname. Meraki is a word that modern Greeks often use to describe what happens when you leave a piece of yourself (your soul, creativity, or love) in your work. When you love doing something, anything, so much that you put something of yourself into it. So, this kid is our Meraki.

We have yet to decide on the first name.

Noira is jessica's fav so far. It doesn't have any specific meaning, we like the sound of it.

Orena is my fav option so far. Orena is the force believed by the Iroquois people to be present, in varying degrees, in all objects or persons, and to be the spiritual force by which human accomplishment is attained or accounted for. For example "a successful hunter's orenda overcomes that of his quarry"

We are open to suggestions on the first name. So please tell us if you have any.

rules:
1. maximum of 3 syllables
2. the name should be easy to pronounce
3. shouldn't start with 'a' or 'z' (too many in our families)
4. shouldn't be common anywhere in the world
5. shouldn't have religious connotations in the big religions of today. rare religions are fine
6. no names of famous figures or companies. less famous ones are fine.
7. no bad meanings in any of the common languages

strong preferences:
1. the name should have a phonetic spelling. Seeing the name should tell people how to pronounce it. For example 'Meraki' does not leave much discretion to how the name should be pronounced. 
2. the spelling should be the simplest form of the name. So, 'meraki' is preferred over 'merakee'
3. no stereotypical feminine meanings such as beautiful, caring, kindness, princess

preferences:
1. first name should sound good with meraki. For example both 'noira meraki' and 'orena meraki' sound good because of the alliterative 'r' sound.
2. the meaning should be associated with ability, skill, action. Something that can be acquired, not something that can be given or something that one is born with.
